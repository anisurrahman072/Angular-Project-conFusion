# Angular-Project-conFusion

This project is now working on **json-server**. I have added the json-server inside my project. 

### Run json-server
You can run the json-server by this command: `json-server --watch db.json -d 2000` 

### Run conFusion Project
You have to run this command to start the Angular Project: `npm start`
